# Graphgear Derived Pen
## Prototype pen built around my production Graphgear 1000 bodies

I'm slowly exploring ways to expand my product offerings, and I often get requests to make a ballpoint conversion kit for the graphgear.

Turns out, that's fairly complicated, and difficult to offer in volume. So, why not build something that uses the two parts of the pencil I already make myself? 

A fun little evening project I recently finished. This little pen has a ~9mm OD. It uses a PR4 (Fisher) or Uni PowerTank refill, both oil based. It's grip and body are compatible with Pentel GraphGear 1000 parts.
