# First Pen (2023)

This project is the first in a series of pens I have designed and machined. The bolt action pen has a stepped tip, forward center of mass, and engraved text.
    
A sample of the (admittedly sloppy) working drawings I drafted can be seen in the background of the image above.

All the milling for this project was done on my benchtop CNC router, which I designed and built in 2022. For a relatively large machine, I think it did a fantastic job milling the tiny J-slot mechanism into the pen.
