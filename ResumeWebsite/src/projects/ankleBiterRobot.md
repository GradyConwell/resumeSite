# AnkleBiter (2023)
<div class="project-content-wrapper">
        This page is still under construction! Check back soon. 

        The AnkleBiter robot was built for the 2023-24 FIRST Tech Challenge competition season. In my role as a hardware lead, I delegated tasks, and designed parts for the robot. 

        My team captain directed me to design a novel swerve-type drivetrain system, where each wheel is indepedent, and capable of infinite steering. To accomplish this, I worked closely with Josh, our software lead, to design the motion control system required to operate a differential swerve drivetrain. It took several months of constant iteration to create the two competition ready swerve drive modules.

        While exciting, and time consuming, the swerve drivetrain didn't end up being the most exciting part of AnkleBiter. Instead, the powerful robot arm affixed to the front defined our competitiveness.
