# About Me

I am a student at California State University, Chico, pursuing a dual major in Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronic Engineering. In 2023, I embarked on my entrepreneurial journey by selling my first product on eBay: a precision brass replacement component for a popular mechanical pencil. 

In addition to my side-hustle as a soloprenuer, I've continued to pursue several personal engineering projects. I am most proud of my cheap, easy to use CNC router, which I designed and built in 2022. Currently, I am making progress towards first chips on a small gang tool CNC lathe, designed to support my small business.

At Chico State, I am a member of our Society of Manufacturing Engineers' chapter (SME). In my current role, I mentor members in manual machining, and design for manufacturing. Additional information about projects I've completed for class and SME can be found below.
