# About Me

I am a student at California State University, Chico, pursuing a dual major in Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronic Engineering. In 2023, I embarked on my entrepreneurial journey by selling my first product on eBay: a precision brass replacement component for a popular mechanical pencil. 

In addition to my side-hustle as a soloprenuer, I've continued to pursue several personal engineering projects. I am most proud of my cheap, easy to use CNC router, which I designed and built in 2022. Currently, I am making progress towards first chips on a small gang tool CNC lathe, designed to support my small business.

At Chico State, I serve as Vice President for our Society of Manufacturing Engineers’ chapter (SME). My responsibilities include mentoring members in manual machining and design for manufacturing. I oversee machine shop activities and offer technical assistance for the club’s projects. Additional information about projects I've completed for class and SME can be found below.

Outside of work and the classroom, I am all over the map (mind you, a map of California). Whether its feeding my bike to the dirt on some dodgy fire road, taking a moment to sketch the scenery, or shredding the backside of Mammoth Mountain on a fresh tune, I'm always up to something.
