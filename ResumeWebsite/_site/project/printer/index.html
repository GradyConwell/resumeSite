        <h1>Three-D-Printer</h1>
<h2>A one-of-one custom FDM 3d printer (2021)</h2>
<p>I had luckily stumbled back into the hobbyist FDM 3D Print'iverse just before the pandemic shut the world down. Enabled by a wealth of spare time to sink into learning professional CAD software, and inspired by an active open source community, I aspirationally determined that my pandemic goal was to design and build my very own 3D printer.</p>
<p>At the time, I was just fourteen years old and had no practical knowledge of the engineering design process. To solve this predicament, I did what any teenager would do—I spent thousands of hours watching YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Fresh off a few months of Fusion 360 and Solidworks training videos, I started iterating. During breaks between Zoom classes, I meticulously translated each idea into increasingly complex CAD assemblies. Unburdened by trivialities like specifications or planning, I often found myself designing myself into a corner. My age-appropriate solution was brute force: if I got stuck, I would start over.</p>

<p>After a winter of meticulous iteration, I felt ready invest my hard-earned sheckles in an unproven, untested, and original design by an equally unproven, untested, and unoriginal teenager.</p>
<p>I would go so far as to call it a minor miracle that the thing I built with a pile of parts ordered off of Aliexpress, Amazon, and Misumi actually worked. It printed things!</p>
<p>Little boats, tchotchkes, and plastic animals soon adorned my desk. But the most significant aspect was that the printer could make more parts for itself. Consequently, a year of revisions, modifications, and replacements ensued. I “Ship of Theseus’d” the printer into a machine that rivaled the most capable hobbyist setups in its class.</p>
<p>In its most enduring configuration, my printer has contributed parts to almost every project I’ve undertaken, from high school competition robotics to countless revisions of packaging for tiny pencil parts.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I’m grateful that my younger self’s naïve and ambitious printer project—enabled by a once-in-a-lifetime global crisis—was a gateway drug to mechatronics and engineering design.</p>
