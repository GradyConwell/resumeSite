<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a student at California State University, Chico, pursuing a dual major in Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronic Engineering. In 2023, I embarked on an 'entrepreneurial journey' by selling my first product on eBay: a precision brass replacement component for a popular mechanical pencil.</p>
<p>In addition to my side-hustle as a soloprenuer, I've continued to pursue several personal engineering projects. I am most proud of my cheap, easy to use CNC router, which I designed and built in 2022. I am also slowly making progress towards first chips on a small gang tool CNC lathe, originally designed to support my small business.</p>
<p>At Chico State, I serve as Vice President for our Society of Manufacturing Engineers’ chapter (SME). My responsibilities include mentoring members in machining and design for manufacturing. I also offer technical assistance for the club’s projects. Additional information about projects I've completed for class and SME can be found below.</p>
<p>Outside of work and the classroom, I am all over the map (mind you, a map of California). Whether its feeding my bike to the dirt on some dodgy fire road, taking a moment to sketch the scenery, or dawdling off to the post office with a Santa sack of pencil parts, I'm always up to something.</p>
