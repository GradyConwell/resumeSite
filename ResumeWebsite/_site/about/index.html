<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a student at California State University, Chico, pursuing a dual major in Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronic Engineering.</p>
<p>Outside of work and the classroom, I am all over the map (mind you, a map of California). Whether its feeding my bike to the dirt on some dodgy fire road, taking a moment to sketch the scenery, or dawdling off to the post office with a Santa sack of pencil parts, I'm always up to something.</p>
<p>At Chico State, I serve as Vice President / Vice Chair for our Society of Manufacturing Engineers’ chapter (SME). My responsibilities include mentoring members in machining and design for manufacturing. I also lend general technical assistance to the club’s projects.</p>
<p>In 2023, I embarked on an 'entrepreneurial journey' by selling my first product: a precision brass replacement component for a popular mechanical pencil. Two years of refinement later, and I've shipped over six hundred units to happy customers in fifteen countries.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2025, I stumbled into my first grown-up job, as an intern at Copper – an absolutely phenomenal Berkeley-based hardware startup. I don't think I could've asked for a better start to my nascent engineering career. I've since had the privilege to stick around part-time during the fall, despite attending Chico State. It's a bizarre state of affairs, and I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, summer 2026 is still an open question, so if you know of any roles I be a good fit for, reach out!</p>
